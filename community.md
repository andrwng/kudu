### Contributions

There are lots of ways to get involved with the Kudu project. Some of them are
listed below. You don't have to be a developer; there are lots of valuable and
important ways to get involved that suit any skill set and level.

If you want to do something not listed here, or you see a gap that needs to be
filled, [let us know](mailto:dev@kudu.apache.org).

#### Participate in the community.

Community is the core of any open source project, and Kudu is no exception.
Participate in the mailing lists, requests for comment, chat sessions, and bug
reports.

#### Talk about how you use Kudu.

Let us know what you think of Kudu and how you are using it. Send links to
blogs or presentations you've given to the [kudu user mailing
list](mailto:user@kudu.apache.org) so that we can feature them.

#### File bugs and enhancement requests.

If you see problems in Kudu or if a missing feature would make Kudu more useful
to you, let us know by filing a bug or request for enhancement on the [Kudu
JIRA issue tracker](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/KUDU). The more
information you can provide about how to reproduce an issue or how you'd like a
new feature to work, the better.

#### Write code and submit patches.

You can submit patches to the core Kudu project or extend your existing
codebase and APIs to work with Kudu. The Kudu project uses
[Gerrit](http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/#/q/status:open+project:kudu) for code
reviews. Please read the details of [how to submit
patches](docs/contributing.html#_contributing_patches_using_gerrit) and what
the project [coding guidelines](docs/contributing.html#_code_style) are before
your submit your patch, so that your contribution will be easy for others to
review and integrate.

#### Review patches and test new code.

In order for patches to be integrated into Kudu as quickly as possible, they
must be reviewed and tested. The more eyes, the better. Even if you are not a
committer your review input is extremely valuable. Keep an eye on the [Kudu
gerrit instance](http://gerrit.cloudera.org:8080/#/q/status:open+project:kudu)
for patches that need review or testing.

#### Write and review documentation or a blog post.

Making good documentation is critical to making great, usable software. If you
see gaps in the documentation, please submit suggestions or corrections to the
mailing list or submit documentation patches through Gerrit. You can also
correct or improve error messages, log messages, or API docs.

If you'd like to translate the Kudu documentation into a different language or
you'd like to help in some other way, please [let us know](mailto:dev@kudu.apache.org).
It's best to review the [documentation guidelines](docs/contributing.html#_documentation)
before you get started.

#### Request and review examples.

The [kudu-examples](https://github.com/cloudera/kudu-examples) repository
includes working code examples. As more examples are requested and added, they
will need review and clean-up. This is another way you can get involved.

### Meetups, User Groups, and Conference Presentations

If you're interested in hosting or presenting a Kudu-related talk or meetup in
your city, get in touch by sending email to the user mailing list at
[user@kudu.apache.org](mailto:user@kudu.apache.org)
so that we can feature them.

### Articles, Demos, and Reviews

The Kudu community does not yet have a dedicated blog, but if you are
interested in promoting a Kudu-related use case, we can help spread the word.
<br/>
Send email to the user mailing list at
[user@kudu.apache.org](mailto:user@kudu.apache.org)
with your content and we'll help drive traffic.

* Curt Monash from DBMS2 has written a three-part series about Kudu:
  [an introduction to Kudu](http://www.dbms2.com/2015/09/28/introduction-to-cloudera-kudu/),
  a [technical deep dive](http://www.dbms2.com/2015/09/28/cloudera-kudu-deep-dive/),
  and his analysis on
  [the potential significance of Kudu](http://www.dbms2.com/2015/09/28/the-potential-significance-of-cloudera-kudu/).
* Zoomdata has created a video demo of
  [Zoomdata on top of Kudu](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ck_kRb6qLKE)
  demonstrating real-time and point-in-time analytic queries on Kudu while
  simultaneously running a streaming ingest workload.
