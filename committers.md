Committership is a recognition of an individual’s contribution within the
Apache Kudu community, including, but not limited to:

* Writing quality code and tests
* Writing documentation
* Improving the website
* Participating in code review (+1s are appreciated! Reviews help reduce the
  burden on other committers)
* Voting on release candidates (non-binding votes are appreciated! Trying out
  release candidates helps expand test coverage in more environments)
* Answering questions on public forums, like Slack, mailing lists, etc.
* Participating in feature design discussions
* Participating in Jira discussions
* Evangelizing Kudu at conferences, meetups, etc.
* Operating Kudu deployments, potentially testing bug fixes and features, and
  sharing feedback to the community
* Sustained contribution to the Kudu project and community

While not all of these are required to become a committer, they are all taken
into account when considering contributors for committership. There is no set
number of commits required, set number of lines of code merged, or set number
of questions answered that will automatically qualify someone for
committership. The Kudu PMC will take note of contributors and periodically
vote on them, based on past contributions and interactions with the community.

Committership is an acknowledgement from the Kudu PMC that a contributor has
demonstrated solid judgement in their contributions, and demonstrated that they
are thoughtful and collaborative when working on trickier contributions.

If PMC membership is also granted, committership comes with the privilege to
vote on matters that affect the wider Kudu community, including merging code,
moving forward on releases, and introducing new committers. Committership is
intended for those who are interested in the project’s future and want to take
a more active role in shaping it.

For more details about how the Apache Software Foundation defines contributors
and committers, see the [Apache
Contributors](https://community.apache.org/contributors/) page.
